# Decisions

## Phase 0-4 Design Decisions

### Default Language: Filipino
- **Decision:** All UI text, narration, and content should default to Filipino (Tagalog) on first launch.
- **Rationale:** Target audience is Filipino Grade 1 learners; many cannot read well. Voice narration is primary, requiring Filipino audio.
- **Implementation:**
  - `settings.json` defaults `narrationLanguage = "fil"`
  - `strings_en.json` and `strings_fil.json` both required
  - Language toggle enabled in settings (Phase 15)
- **Impact:**
  - Requires bilingual strings for all screens
  - Default TTS locale: `fil-PH` with `en-US` fallback
  - Teacher setup shows Filipino prompts initially

### Voice Name Entry
- **Decision:** Student names should be entered via voice recording, not text input.
- **Rationale:** Target audience (6-7 year olds) cannot yet read or type their names reliably; voice recognition is intuitive and inclusive.
- **Implementation:**
  - Add `speechRecognizer` permission to AndroidManifest.xml
  - Create `VoiceNameRecorder` composable with microphone button
  - Display recognized text in large, labeled box
  - Provide "Retake" button to retry recording
  - Alternative: tap-to-pick from a list of common Filipino names
- **Fallback:** Manual typing option for cases where speech recognition fails (rare in practice with MediaPipe/Marvin TTS context)

### Avatar Selection in Login
- **Decision:** Add 8 predefined avatar icons that students can tap to select.
- **Rationale:** Kids identify with visual characters; provides instant avatar to personalize experience.
- **Implementation:**
  - Use vector avatars in `drawables`
  - Display in a 4x2 grid in login screen
  - Tapping selects avatar and fills outlines on character
  - "Make my own!" option separately in Phase 13
  - Disable tapping until voice name is captured
- **Date:** 2026-10-19

### Bilingual Content Strategy
- **Decision:** All JSON content (phonics, numbers, stories, etc.) will contain both `text_en` and `text_fil` fields.
- **Rationale:** Voice narration is primary; having all content in Filipino by default ensures no switches are needed for common use.
- **Implementation:**
  - Update `strings_en.json` and `strings_fil.json` to contain all app strings in both languages (when applicable)
  - Content loader reads current language from DataStore before selecting `text_xxx` fields
  - Error handling if missing string (developer error)
